Hello {CANDIDATE_NAME},

As we count down to your first day at Halojasa, we’d like to invite you to a pre-onboarding welcome call!
This is a great opportunity to meet other new team members, get helpful tips for onboarding, and ask our team any lingering questions ahead of your start date. At Halojasa, we call this type of Q&A session an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA), so any and all questions are welcomed.
The call is completely optional, but we’d love to see you there!

When: {DATES}

Please let us know if you have questions for now.
All the best,
